            <div class="product-description">
              3pigs is a band I play drums and do vocals in. We are a punk/metal/shoegaze/electronic band. This band was the first band that I played drums in, and my bandmates are some of my closest friends so this project is very special. We currently have an ep called "When Pigs Fly" on streaming, and we are in the midst of making an album!

              Thread In is a project I joined recently as of March, 2025. Thread In is an emo/slowcore band. I play drums in this band as well. I wasn't a founder of this band, and am replacing the original drummer. The release shown above, has the original drummer playing on it, but we will be recording new music soon!

            <h3>Lethargic Complex</h3>
            <div class="product-description">
              Lethargic Complex is a solo project that I worked on during 2024. Lethargic Complex is a black metal project. I wrote and mixed all of the songs myself, and played all instruments except drums. This project is very personal to me, since it was my first ever solo release and I am hoping to create more music like this in the future.

            <h3>Salem</h3>
            <div class="product-description">
              Salem is not a band I am part of, just a band I love. Salem is a witch house band. They are very influential to me due to how noisy and raw yet beautiful their music is. It's a great contrast that I always strive to mimic when I write my own music.
